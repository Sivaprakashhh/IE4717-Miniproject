# IE4717-Miniproject

This project involves the creation of a web portal for purchasing consumer electronics and IT products online. The application will allow users to browse through various categories of products, view detailed product information, and select items for purchase. A shopping cart system will be implemented to manage items before finalizing orders. Additionally the portal will also acknowledge and update the status of the orders via email notifications. For customer service purposes, the portal would also include a dedicated phone line and email address for customers to contact if they were to have any queries or concerns regarding our products. The primary focus of the project is to facilitate a convenient and functional online shopping experience for electronics and IT products.
